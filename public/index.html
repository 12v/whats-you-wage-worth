                  <p>Inflation is a measure of how much the prices of good (such as food or televisions) and services (such as haircuts or train tickets) have gone up over time.</p>

                  <p>Usually people measure inflation by comparing the cost of things today with how much they cost a year ago.  The average increase in price is know as the inflation rate.</p>

                  <p>So if inflation is 3%, it means prices are 3% higher (on average) than they were a year ago.  For example, if a load of bread cost £1 a year ago and now it's £1.03 then its price has risen by 3%.</p>

                  <p>Inflation means that what you can buy with a certain amount of money today is less than it was in the past.</p>

                  What is the difference between real terms pay changes and nominal pay changes?

                  <p>A 'nominal' pay change is a change in the amount of money someone is paid, as represented by a change in the number after the £ sign.</p>
                  <p>A 'real terms' pay change is a change in the value of the money that someone is paid, a change in what you can buy with that money.  This requires a calculation involving additional information besides your pay, so can be hard to gauge intuitively.</p>


                  <p>For example, if you are paid £20,000 one year, and £21,000 the next year, you have received a 5% nominal pay rise.</p>
                  <p>However, if in this time the rate of inflation is 10%, you have actually received a real terms pay cut of 5%.</p>
                  <p>This means that despite earning a larger amount of money, you can buy less with your pay this year than you could last year.</p>
